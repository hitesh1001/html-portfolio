<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey guys Hitesh here , I am learning  web developement currently and its actually a pretty nice experiance as 
   I can do alot crazy things with html too , when I started I thought it would be to tough  , 
   but guess what I started enjoying it even more, it's actually one of my favourite thing to do now .
</p>

<p> I am a engineering undergrad so I always try to explore tech related things , I am also into playing chess and cricket .
    Watching youtube while eating is my guilty pleasure but still not that bad though to feel guilty about it , 
   listening to music whenever I get the time throughout the day it just gets me to the places where can just dream of to going  ,
   also i love to watch to movies thanks to the dawg who invented the cinema , 
   legendery contribution to humanity and this is all and this is me ://
</p>
